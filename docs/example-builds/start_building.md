# Start Building

> This section is under progress and will be updated shortly.

This section acts as a growing repository for different confidentiality solutions. The idea is that once developers have gone through a respective quickstart, they can find common implementation examples, patterns, and more integrating with Fairblock.

<!-- TODO: make a repo where the patterns can live in a way that is easy to organize and point to.
TODO: not sure if we will keep this section as a result, or simply have this one page and point to the repo -->

If you're interested in building out common patterns, please reach out to us! We always welcome new and interesting integration patterns to broaden the Fairblock ecosystem.
