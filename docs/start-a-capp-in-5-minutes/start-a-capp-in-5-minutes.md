# Run a Confidential Apps within 5 Minutes

The following pages will run you through creating a Confidential App, or cApp, unlocking confidential computation using Fairblock's decentralized blockchain, FairyRing. cApps take the form as an App on a network like FairyRing, an EVM, or even as an other independent chain itself.

The two quick examples cover:

_** Most of our integration guides and tutorials focus on applications built using **MPC** and **IBE**, such as **frontrunning protection**, **auctions**, **prediction markets**, **limit orders**, **decentralized selective disclosure**, and **access control**.

For **confidential stablecoin transfers**, we use **Homomorphic Encryption (HE)**. This application **does not require special integrations or developer setup**. It works seamlessly across **all Fairblock-integrated chains**, including **EVM chains, Solana, Cosmos chains, and FairyRing itself**. Developers **do not need to deploy or install any precompiles, modules, or smart contracts**; everything is **handled automatically by Fairblockâ€™s own contracts and partner deployments** on each supported chain.**_

2. [Starting a cApp on an EVM](./evm_capp.md)

These examples offer a quick taste of the new paradigm with confidential computation.

For developers who are looking to build with FairyRing, either natively, or within their another chain, are encouraged to reference the respective tutorials within the [build section](../build/).
