# Run a Confidential Apps within 5 Minutes

The following pages will run you through creating a Confidential App, or cApp, unlocking confidential computation using Fairblock's decentralized blockchain, FairyRing. cApps take the form as an App on a network like FairyRing, an EVM, or even as an other independent chain itself.

The two quick examples cover:

1. [Starting a cApp on FairyRing](./fairyring_capp.md)
2. [Starting a cApp on an EVM](./evm_capp.md)

These examples offer a quick taste of the new paradigm with confidential computation.

For developers who are looking to build with FairyRing, either natively, or within their another chain, are encouraged to reference the respective tutorials within the [build section](../build/). 

Let's get started!
