# Introduction

Privacy is desperately lacking in blockchain networks and their applications. This lack is a critical roadblock to the global adoption of blockchains - a roadblock that stands tall for millions of everyday users and institutions alike.

Fairblock is building programmable privacy solutions that serve as building blocks for decentralized applications and networks. We’re developing encryption and privacy-preserving services that can be integrated directly into application frontends and as deep as the protocol level of blockchains. No more bootstrapping new decentralized trust networks or protocol layers to access the benefits of privacy; instead, any application or protocol can tie into Fairblock and plug programmable privacy into their tech stack.

Leveraging advanced cryptographic schemes including identity-based encryption (IBE), witness encryption (WE), and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), Fairblock is building blockchain infrastructure for programmable privacy and conditional decryption. These technologies help protect the content of transactions from malicious bots, competitors, and other adversaries.

Programmable privacy and conditional decryption can be useful for a wide range of privacy-preserving use cases including encrypted on-chain intents (limit orders, stop-loss orders, programmable trading), bad-MEV prevention, private governance, trustless Bitcoin bridging, censorship and front-running resistant shared sequencing, privacy-preserving rollups, on-chain gaming, legal contracts, randomness generation oracles, and any scenario where asymmetric information limits the use of a decentralized application.

Fairblock is currently in the first phase of its rollout, strictly utilizing Threshold IBE and WE for its privacy features. We have an applied research and development arm committed to exploring and furthering practical implementations of FHE and more advanced forms of Witness Encryption, each of which will eventually be implemented at the protocol level. We look forward to collaborating with members of the blockchain and cryptography communities to complete our vision and enshrine privacy as a standard in blockchain networks and their applications.

We will be using our [Discord](https://discord.gg/8zFvUJrz3z) to engage in technical discussions with our community, as well as distribute protocol updates, opportunities, and immaculate vibes. We’re excited for you to join us!
