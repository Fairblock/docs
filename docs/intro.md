# Introduction

At Fairblock we believe that a lack of privacy on-chain is one of the major barriers to adoption of decentralized applications.
This holds true for millions of everyday end-users as well as big institutions and corporate use cases.
On-chain privacy protection is lacking for many existing blockchain networks and applications.

Fairblock is working on fully on-chain privacy solutions that serve as building blocks for decentralized applications and networks.
Weâ€™re developing encryption and privacy-preserving services that can be used directly in the frontend of decentralized applications alongside networks seeking privacy at the protocol level.

Leveraging advanced cryptographic schemes including identity-based encryption (IBE), witness encryption (WE), and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), Fairblock is building blockchain infrastructure for programmable privacy and conditional decryption.
These technologies help protect the content of transactions from malicious bots, competitors, and other adversaries.

This can be useful for a wide range of privacy-preserving use cases including encrypted on-chain intents (limit orders, stop-loss orders, programmable trading), bad-MEV prevention, private governance, censorship-resistant shared sequencing, on-chain gaming, on-chain legal contracts, randomness generation oracles, and any scenario where asymmetric information limits the use of a decentralized application.
