# Ecosystem

The new types of applications that are unlocked using Fairblock's Dynamic Confidential Computing is vast. It takes a thriving community to grab this opportunity to build a safer, more performant and innovative web3. Check out our showcase projects, explore the ideas that need people like you to build it, and get to know the community.

> See below for showcase projects. See the ideas page [here](TODO-GetLink) for even more projects that could be built or are currently being built today.

## Showcase Projects

The Fairblock ecosystem is actively growing. Blockchain application categories and projects that are being focused on are listed. Summaries are provided below, and more details can be found in the respective links for each project.

### Fair DeFi and Credible Auctions

Fairblock unlocks credible and confidential DeFi mechanisms. Leaderless, sealed-bid auctions and different use cases for them are of particular interest, especially with the recent Arbitrum grant awarded to the Fairblock project.

#### [DeBid Arbitrum Grant for Ecosystem Auctions](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=671a105a2047c84bb8a73770&chainId=10&isRenderingProposalBody=true&proposalId=6775ba29faef5017a8fafd6c)

Fairblock will build fully onchain confidential auction infrastructure on Arbitrum, serving DeFi, NFT, RWA, and tokenization apps. Fairblock will leverage Stylus to bring sealed-bid auctions fully onchain to produce better pricing for apps that use auctions to settle swaps, cross-chain token routing, perps and options, liquidations, and sales for memecoins, ICOs, NFTs, and RWAs. Stylus allows us to deploy our Rust decryption contracts to make onchain sealed-bid auctions possible onchain and empower users and apps with more capital-efficient and credible auction mechanisms.

#### Anoma Sealed-Bid Auctions for General Intents

<!-- TODO: Write description -->

Systems based on intents are more performant than historic DeFi applications, but are a nascent space today still. An exciting area of intent-based application development is the usage of sealed-bid auctions to innovate on current fully-public intent based systems. Current systems, on-chain, are fully public, but they typically rely on off-chain solvers, that can become monopolistic. Pairing the general intent based systems from Anoma, new application development is being explored initially with a DEX application that allows users to specify intents and customize the auction mechanisms for winning solvers. Iteratively, the entire intent setup can further improve using dynamic confidential computing, including dynamic and fair price discovery.

#### Squid Sealed-Bid Auctions for Crosschain Intents

<!-- TODO: Write description -->

We propose a decentralised sealed bid auction model for pricing intents across any chain. Powered by IBE, we believe this is the best design as far as price discovery, decentralization, and efficiency.

#### Fair Token Launch System Using a Threshold-Encrypted Onchain Sealed-Bid Auction

<!-- TODO: Write description -->

#### [Encrypted Programmable Orders with CoWSwap](https://swap.fairycow.fi/#/11155111/limit/WETH?tab=open&page=1)

### Confidential AI

<!-- TODO: combine the below into a nice paragraph describing the power of Fairblock and confidential computation in these arenas, and then point them to the blog post. -->

### Hidden Information GameFi

(GameFi is an important focus, using encryption for hidden-information games: pay-to-decrypt, mysteries, on-chain randomness, PvP gaming, betting, highest unique bid auctions.)
