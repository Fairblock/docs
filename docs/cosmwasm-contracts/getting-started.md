# Getting Started

In order to compile and deploy cosmwasm contracts, first instsll Go and Rust as explained in [getting-started](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/docs/getting-started/installation). Installing wasmd is not required for using cosmwasm on FairyRing.

Then, install the `fairyring` binary as described in [Running-a-node](https://docs.fairblock.network/docs/running-a-node/installation).

Next step is to write a cosmwasm contract.
