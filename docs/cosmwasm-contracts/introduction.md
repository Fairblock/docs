# What is CosmWasm?
CosmWasm provides a platform to add smart contracts to the Cosmos ecosystem. It is implemented as a module that can be integrated with the Cosmos SDK adding the smart contract functionality to any cosmos chain. 
Currently, Rust is the main language used for writing the cosmwasm contracts.
