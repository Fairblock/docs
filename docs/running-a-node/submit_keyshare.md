# Submitting keyshares to `fairyring`

This tutorial goes over on different ways to submit keyshares to `fairyring` and in particular, to the `keyshare` module.
Make sure you have installed [`fairyring`](./installation.md) prior to following the instructions below.

## Requirements

In order to be able to submit keyshare to `fairyring`, there are few requirements:

1. You are a [validator](./validating_on_testnet.md) in the staking module with a minimum `10000000000ufairy` staked.
Check if you are currently a validator as well as how many tokens you have staked with the following command:

```bash
fairyringd q staking validators 
```

2. You registered as a validator in the `fairyring` `keyshare` module. Check if you are in the validator set with following command:

```bash
fairyringd q keyshare list-validator-set
```

You can register as a validator in the `keyshare` module with the following command (replace `YOUR_WALLET_NAME` with your account name in your keyring):

```bash
fairyringd tx keyshare register-validator --from YOUR_WALLET_NAME
```

**NOTE: If you are submitting keyshares with `fairyringclient`, you can skip registering as a validator because the client will do it for you.**

## `fairyringclient`

`fairyringclient` is a tool which:
    1. Fetches your master keyshare from our [Share Generation Client](./share_generation_client.md)
    2. Computes the derived keyshare every block
    3. Automatically submits the derived keyshare to `fairyring` every block.

This is the recommended way to submit keyshares.
Make sure you have completed the steps in the [prerequisites](./prerequisites.md) prior to following the instructions below.

1. Download & Install `fairyringclient` by the following command:

```bash
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/Fairblock/fairyringclient.git
cd fairyringclient
go mod tidy
go install
```

2. Initialize the `fairyringclient` config:

```bash
fairyringclient config init
```

3. Check the client config:

```bash
fairyringclient config show
```

Example output of the command:

```bash
Using config file: /Users/fairblock/.fairyringclient/config.yml
GRPC Endpoint: 127.0.0.1:9090
FairyRing Node Endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:26657
Chain ID: fairyring-testnet-1
Chain Denom: ufairy
InvalidSharePauseThreshold: 5
MetricsPort: 2222
```

4. Update the client config:

```bash
fairyringclient config update
```

Here are the flags for updating different field of the config:

- `--chain-id CHAIN_ID`, `CHAIN_ID` is the chain id you are working with, the current default is `fairyring-testnet-1`
- `--denom DENOM`, `DENOM` is the token denom of the chain, default is `ufairy`
- `--grpc-port PORT`, `PORT` is the gRPC port of the node you are connecting to, default is `9090`
- `--ip IP`, `IP` is the IP address of the node you are connecting to, default is `"127.0.0.1"`
- `--metrics-port METRICS_PORT`, `METRICS_PORT` is the port for Prometheus metrics to listen to, default is `2222`
- `--pause-threshold THRESHOLD`, stops the client if it submits `THRESHOLD` invalid keyshares in a row, default is `5`
- `--port NODE_PORT`, `NODE_PORT` is the port of the node you are connecting to, default is `26657`
- `--protocol PROTOCOL`, `PROTOCOL` is the protocol of the node you are connecting to, default is `"http"`

5. Add validator account private key

```bash
fairyringclient keys set "private key in hex"
```

**The private key should be the validator address that is staking on fairyring chain**  
  
Example:
  
```bash  
> fairyringclient keys set f5c691d4b53ec8c3a3ad35e88525f9b8f33d307b3414c93f1b856265409a3a04
Using config file: /Users/fairblock/.fairyringclient/config.ymlSuccessfully added cosmos private key to config!
```  
  
6. Check the key is added to the client correctly:
  
```bash  
> fairyringclient keys show  
Using config file: /Users/fairblock/.fairyringclient/config.yml
Private Key: f5c691d4b53ec8c3a3ad35e88525f9b8f33d307b3414c93f1b856265409a3a04  
```

**The `[0]` at the beginning of the key is the index of your key, which is used to delete the key**

7. Start the client:

```bash
fairyringclient start
```

The log will look something like this when it started submitting keyshare:

```bash
2023/01/01 00:00:00 Latest Block Height: 12345 | Deriving Share for Height: 12346                
2023/01/01 00:00:00 Current Share Expires at: 20000 | {01 5a3cc54cb8fc2cae480a58d2922d84d69376726ed859615c6bd869154cb4ccc2}                
2023/01/01 00:00:00 [0] Submit KeyShare for Height 12345 Confirmed
```

### Troubleshooting

If you run into any issues, please refer to theÂ [troubleshooting section](../faqs/troubleshooting_fairyringclient.md)

## Submitting via `fairyring` directly

You can submit keyshare with the `fairyringd` binary manually.
First ensure that the [requirements](#requirements) are met before proceeding.

```bash
fairyringd tx keyshare send-keyshare [keyshare-in-hex] [keyshare-index] [block-height] --from YOUR_ACCOUNT
```

Here is an example command with arguments:

```bash
fairyringd tx keyshare send-keyshare "8d9627890df55aab18188538f7d412fb03fc85ccb953c179e49a9a87e94938f414dabb308ae15e6a720a57494526c35504a49d13719718dac8ed2fabace0a1c4466e257f51d1b9243c1a519126a3024ef992b2ebe3ae965a2e9305b7247a6aa6" 1 1 --from alice
```

Explanation on the example command:

- `8d9627...a6aa6` is the derived keyshare encoded in hex format.
- The first `1` is the keyshare index, which is a number starting from 1.
- The second `1` is the keyshare height, which is the height that the keyshare derived from.
- `--from alice` is the account name you are sending the keyshare from, `alice` is in this case.
