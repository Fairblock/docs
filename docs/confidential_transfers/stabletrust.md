# Stabletrust

## Confidential stablecoins and transfers powered by Fairblock
Stabletrust is the unified browser-based interface for users, traders, businesses, and institutions on all major EVM chains, Solana, and payments networks. It includes:
- Wallet integrations
- Local, browser-based, lightweight Homomorphic Encryption and ZK proof generation 
- Balance decryption for users
- Confidential transfers for major stablecoins

Stabletrust can be used seamlessly by users without typical UX burdens including volatile privacy coins, interacting bridging funds, encryption delays, or changing wallets. It’s an all-in-one interface to start sending confidential transfers immediately without any prior setup or specialized knowledge.
## What you can do
- Send and receive stablecoins with amounts and balances kept confidential
- Preserve composability and compliance
- Disclose per-transaction details to finance, auditors, banks, or regulators only when needed (no single decrytion key for all transactions)
- Access from major chains without wrapping or bridging funds
## Who it’s for
- Individuals: everyday spending and transfers without leaking amounts or relationships
- Businesses and institutions: confidential payroll, commercial terms, and treasury moves with on-demand selective disclosure for auditors, regulators, and banks
- Traders: reduce information leakage (order size, timing) while settling on public chains

## Supported networks
- Chains: Major EVM chains and payment networks (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Arc, Tempo, Noble AppLayer, Stable), FairyRing, and soon: Solana, Stellar, and others.
- Deposit Assets: USDC, USDT, USDG, Fairblock's yield-bearing Confidential USD to start. More assets (e.g. Encrypted BTC, ETH, RWAs) can be added based on issuer and partner demand
