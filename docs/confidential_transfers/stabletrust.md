# Stabletrust

## Confidential payments and transfers powered by Fairblock
Stabletrust is the browser-based interface for users, traders, businesses, and institutions. It includes:
- Wallet integrations
- Local, browser-based ZK proof generation 
- Balance decryption for users
- Transact on FairyRing or other chains

Stabletrust can be used directly by FairRing users or by users on other chains without interacting with FairyRing directly and without bridging funds. It’s an all-in-one interface to start sending confidential transfers immediately without any prior setup or specialized knowledge.
## What you can do
- Send and receive stablecoins with amounts and balances kept confidential
- Preserve composability (addresses stay transparent)
- Disclose per-transaction details to finance, auditors, banks, or regulators only when needed
- Access from major chains without wrapping or bridging funds
## Who it’s for
- Individuals: everyday spending and transfers without leaking amounts or relationships
- Traders: reduce information leakage (order size, timing) while settling on public chains
- Businesses and institutions: confidential payroll, commercial terms, and treasury moves with on-demand selective disclosure for auditors, regulators, and banks
## Supported networks
- Chains: FairyRing, EVM (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Noble AppLayer, Hyperliquid, Base, etc.). Soon: Solana and others
- Assets: USDC, USDT to start. More assets (e.g. ETH, RWAs) can be added based on issuer and partner demand
