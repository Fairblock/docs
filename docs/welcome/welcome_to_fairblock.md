# Build Further with the Dynamic Confidentiality Network

Fairblock is a dynamic confidentiality network that delivers high performance, low overhead, and custom confidential execution to blockchain applications. Dynamic confidentiality unlocks the encrypted economy â€” onchain applications designed for real-world use cases, like credible and capital efficient DeFi protocols (e.g. intent matching in confidential auctions), AI inference (e.g. trading strategy optimization without leaking private inputs or models), frontrunning mitigation, or SocialFi/GameFi (e.g. play to decrypt, VRF, private voting, lotteries, predictions).

> **The Fairblock network, FairyRing, is currently available as a testnet with MPC and threshold IBE, which offer conditional confidentiality dependent on each application and users' needs.**

Two core functions are possible today:

1. Export accessible confidential computation for external chains and applications.
2. Host native performant applications only possible with confidentiality.

Current areas of research and development focus on dynamicity for confidentiality solutions such as computation over encrypted data, private input verification, and proxy reencryption.

These docs will provide instructions for:

1. Integrating conditional encryption from Fairblock in applications on FairyRing, EVM or Cosmos SDK-based chains.
2. Validators supporting the Fairblock chain, FairyRing.
