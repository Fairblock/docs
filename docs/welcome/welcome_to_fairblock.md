<!-- Changes to be made:
- Rename this section to Welcome instead of Intro
- Outline clear vision statement & how Fairblock technologies unlocks new paradigms in blockchain ecosystem. List some key examples & key gotchas (what it is vs what it isn't).
- MVP on buttons, add links to learn and build sections.
- Move old content from this page to new "Learn" section at the start. -->

# Welcome

<!-- Need input from high-level team as this is an important page for introducing people to project. -->

<!-- Vision statement and what it does -->
Fairblock is a Cosmos Appchain focused on creating a safer blockchain space with more unlocked potential. Currently in its testnet stage, it does this by introducing a new paradigm of encryption and conditional decryption and execution, that developers can use to unlock new blockchain use cases.

<!-- The key thing it unlocks. TODO - Perhaps we need a schematic here actually simply showing apps integrating with Fairyring / Fairblock to encrypt and decrypt -->
The transparency of the blockchain, specifically pending transactions within the mempool, has been a default challenge developers and users have to work with. There are a vast range of applications and services that are in some way blocked by this. For example, how do you create a simple poker application, a sealed bid auction, or something more complex like MEV prevention? 

Fairblock technologies help solve this challenge by offering encryption and conditional decryption and execution. Transaction details are always transparent, but **only once fully executed where state change has occurred.** Fairblock empowers developers to:

- Integrate into Fairblock for programmable encryption, and paired conditional decryption and execution into their tech stack (both AppChains & EVMs).
- Leverage advanced cryptographic schemes including threshold identity-based encryption (tIBE), and threshold fully homomorphic encryption (tFHE)

The docs here are organized to meet the needs of two main demographics: developers building apps, and validators supporting the Fairblock chain, Fairyring. They primarily provide information for developer quickstarts, fundamentals within the Learn section, and how to support the validator network.
