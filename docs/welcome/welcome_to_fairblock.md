# Welcome

<!-- Need input from high-level team as this is an important page for introducing people to project. -->

<!-- Vision statement and what it does -->
Fairblock is a Cosmos Appchain focused on creating a safer blockchain space with more unlocked potential. Currently in its testnet stage, it does this by introducing a new paradigm of encryption and conditional decryption and execution, that developers can use to unlock new blockchain use cases.

<!-- The key thing it unlocks. TODO - Perhaps we need a schematic here actually simply showing apps integrating with Fairyring / Fairblock to encrypt and decrypt -->
The transparency of the blockchain, specifically pending transactions within the mempool, has been a default challenge developers and users have to work with. There are a vast range of applications and services that are in some way blocked by this. For example, how do you create a simple poker application, a sealed bid auction, or something more complex like MEV prevention? 

Fairblock technologies help solve this challenge by offering encryption and conditional decryption and execution. Transaction details are always transparent, but **only once fully executed where state change has occurred.** Fairblock empowers developers to:

- Integrate into Fairblock for programmable encryption, and paired conditional decryption and execution into their tech stack (both AppChains & EVMs).
- Leverage advanced cryptographic schemes including threshold identity-based encryption (tIBE), and threshold fully homomorphic encryption (tFHE)

<!-- TODO - not sure about this paragraph being here -->
Fairblock is currently in the first phase of its rollout, strictly utilizing tIBE and witness encryption for its encryption features. We have an applied research and development arm committed to exploring and furthering practical implementations of FHE and more advanced forms of Witness Encryption, each of which will eventually be implemented at the protocol level. 

The docs here are organized to meet the needs of two main demographics: developers building apps, and validators supporting the Fairblock chain, Fairyring. They primarily provide information for developer quickstarts, fundamentals within the Learn section, and how to support the validator network. 

We look forward to collaborating with members of the blockchain and cryptography communities to complete our vision and enshrine encryption as a standard in blockchain networks and their applications. Come join the fun at our community here at our [Discord](https://discord.gg/8zFvUJrz3z). We carry out technical discussions with our community, as well as distribute protocol updates, opportunities, and immaculate vibes. Weâ€™re excited for you to join us!
