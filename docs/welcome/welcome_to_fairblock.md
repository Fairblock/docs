# Build Farther with the Dynamic Confidentiality Network

Fairblock is a dynamic confidentiality network that delivers high performance, low overhead, and custom confidential execution to blockchain applications. Dynamic confidentiality unlocks the encrypted economy — onchain applications designed for real-world use cases, like credible and captial efficient DeFi protocols (e.g. intent matching in confidential auctions), AI inference (e.g. trading strategy optimization without leaking private inputs or models), frontrunning mitigation, or SocialFi and games (e.g. play to decrypt، private voting, predictions).

V1 is live on testnet with bespoke MPEC and threshold condition id-based encryption, which offer conditional confidentiality dependent on users’ needs. Two core functions are possible today:

1. Export confidential computation for external chains and applications.
2. Host native applications only possible with confidentiality.

Our V2 will support more dynamicity for confidentiality solutions such as computation over encrypted data, private input verification, and proxy reencryption.

These docs will provide instructions for:

1. Integrating threshold decryption and randomness from Fairblock in applications on FairyRing, Arbitrum and EVM chains, or Cosmos SDK-based chains.
2. Validators supporting the Fairblock chain, Fairyring.
