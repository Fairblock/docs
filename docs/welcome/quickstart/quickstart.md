# Developer Quickstart: Build Confidential Apps or Chains with Fairyring

A Confidential App, or cApp, unlocks programmable encryption and paired conditional decryption and execution using Fairblock's decentralized blockchain, Fairyring. They can take the form as an App itself on a network like an EVM or other independent chain itself.

> **Fairblock can already be integrated with EVMs, RollUps, Cosmos Chains, RustVMs, and other blockchains. Different FairyKits are used to integrate into different chains.**

When working with Fairyring, there are two main developer audiences that have been highlighted, and subsequent quickstarts will be provided to assist them.

1. Blockchain Developers working on their own chains leveraging Fairblock, including, but not limited to, Roll-Ups and Cosmos Chains.
2. App Developers creating apps on EVMs or other blockchains.

> **App Developers do not need to know how to setup the blockchain integration, and Blockchain Developers do not need to know how to setup apps.**

### Quickstarts

These quickstarts will guide you through the steps to spin up a local blockchain quickly and deploy your own cApps using fairyring functionality.

> **Within each quickstart, developers are invited to skip ahead if they have already integrated the Fairblock modules within the chain that they are working with. This is the recommended route app developers take if possible, and is clearly marked within the beginning of each quickstart.**

More tutorials are being actively worked on showcasing different integration setups, and will be published more over the coming months. If you would like help integrating with a different tech stack that our current tutorials do not cover, please reach out!
