# Developer Quickstart: Encrypt & Decrypt with EVMs

<!-- Define the key gotchas of how apps and appchains work with Fairblock tech.
- Split this section into AppChain & EVMs
- Provide relevant SDKs
- Provide a quick start repo showcasing key simple integration points (easily understood for ppl wanting to bring it to their own projects)
- Deploy quickstart example to test appchains and test EVMs (that are compatible) -->

<!-- Show visual for apps and appchains talking to Fairyring -->

Follow each of these tutorials to build either an app or appchain to:

1. [Clone the respective repo and set up your dev environment](TODO-GetLink)
2. [Write, compile, and test your first encrypted/decrypted app using Fairblock in a local dev environment](TODO-GetLink)
