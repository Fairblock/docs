# Vision

## An Inflection Point

Blockchain technology gives us tools to eliminate bad behavior. Let’s build toward a future where manipulation is impossible by design. 

The next 16 years should result in more than our legendary memecoin infra and plain transfers.

Businesses and end users will avoid any system that publicly leaks valuable onchain activities and data.

**Onchain confidentiality is the greatest unsolved crisis in crypto.**

## The Opportunity: Decentralized but Manipulation-Free

Fairblock leverages confidential computing to mitigate centralized risks and prevent information leakage and manipulation in decentralized applications. We’ll unlock credible economies and pave the path for the next 16 years, just like internet adoption after it went 80% encrypted.
