# Vision Statement

Confidentiality will turn blockchains from niche speculation to foundations for stronger economies.

The lack of accessible onchain confidentiality keeps major blockchains from supporting products for real-world users. This inaccessibility is due to confidentiality resources requiring costly overhead to operate, making them impractical to offer in every chain and isolating them to privacy-specific chains with few users.

For the internet to be built atop blockchains, confidentiality needs to be made natively available to developers and users in their preferred environments. Fairblock is the confidentiality station for a network of native applications and external protocols leveraging confidential execution to meet the needs of real-world users onchain. The network offers MPEC-based multimodal cryptography for developers to customize confidentiality to the use cases, performance, and security needs of apps and their users.

Dynamic confidentiality is a first-of-its-kind resource, providing developers with maximum choice and flexibility for the degree of confidentiality needed by users in applications. Applications that [dynamic confidentiality unlocks](https://medium.com/@0xfairblock/no-more-plain-vanilla-defi-we-need-more-flavors-1ce16018f7b9) include:
