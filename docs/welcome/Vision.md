# Fairblock

### Confidential Stablecoins and Protected Trading

Circle, Paypal, and Solana are all converging on confidential stablecoin transfers. But fully exposed blockchains aren’t the solution either: they leak sensitive information like stablecoin transfers, trading intents, liquidation triggers, auction bids, and private AI inputs. This information leakage invites exploitation, skews price discovery, and prevents the next wave of high-impact financial applications. Onchain information leakage and manipulation are the biggest bottleneck to trustworthy financial rails and institutional adoption.

Fairblock protects users and funds across stablecoin transfers, orderbooks, and lending protocols. Our dynamic confidential computing accelerates institutional adoption and new applications by protecting sensitive onchain information, securing better prices, and mitigating security risks by removing reliance on fully trusted servers. 

### **Why Fairblock: Product first, not research, not marketing**

- **20+** partnerships: Launched apps and integrations (Arbitrum, Hyperliquid, Uniswap, CowSwap, Squid, Anoma, Axelar, etc) with a focus on:
    1. Confidential and compliant stablecoin transfers
    2. Fair pricing and protected trading, lending, and predictions.

- **Multimodal cryptography:** Dynamic toolkit with tailored, lightweight cryptographic schemes (MPC, threshold IBE, HE, ZK) for each app and use case. No need for unnecessary overhead without compromising security.
- **Meet devs where they are**: Flexible, plug-in composability means devs don’t need to migrate their stack or learn new languages.
- **Architected for compliance** through post-execution selective disclosure ([OFAC](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/CFR-2010-title31-vol3/CFR-2010-title31-vol3-sec500-314), [FinCEN](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-31/subtitle-B/chapter-X/part-1010/subpart-A/section-1010.100#p-1010.100), [MiCA](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32023R1114#d1e4979-86) friendly)
- **Performant**: Fast and cheap client-side encryption: no delays, extra installs, or bridges for end users.
- **Competitive edge:** Modular and chain‑agnostic (vs isolated privacy chains), faster than TFHE‑only plays, no fully trusted centralized coprocessor/relays/hardware, and suitable for native DeFi integration.
- **Proven execution:** Live on public testnet since EthDenver 2024. 63M+ cumulative transactions.
