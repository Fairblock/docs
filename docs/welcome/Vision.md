# Vision Statement

Fairblock is unlocking fair and efficient economies for end users, by eliminating exploitive intermediaries.
Multi-party computation and confidentiality allow decentralizing economies and improve the execution quality for end users by ensuring that their onchain interactions or information is not exposed to centralized or privileged parties such as bots, competitors, exploitative relayers, auctioneers, searchers, or institutions. 

Confidentiality will turn blockchains from niche speculation to foundations for stronger economies. The lack of accessible onchain confidentiality keeps major blockchains from supporting products for real-world users. This inaccessibility is due to confidentiality resources requiring costly overhead to operate, making them impractical to offer in every chain and isolating them to privacy-specific chains with few users.

For the internet to be built atop blockchains, confidentiality needs to be made natively available to developers and users in their preferred environments. Fairblock is the confidentiality station for a network of native applications and external protocols leveraging confidential execution to meet the needs of real-world users onchain. The network leverages MPC-based multimodal cryptography, allowing developers to tailor performance, security, and costs to their applicationsâ€™ unique requirements.

Applications that [dynamic confidentiality unlocks](https://medium.com/@0xfairblock/no-more-plain-vanilla-defi-we-need-more-flavors-1ce16018f7b9) include:
