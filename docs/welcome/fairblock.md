# Fairblock

Most Web3 applications still depend on centralized intermediaries, making protocols less secure and vulnerable to manipulation. However, fully public onchain interactions create new risks exposing end users, solvers, AI agents, market makers, and other participants to exploitative tactics that degrade execution quality.

Fairblock leverages confidential computing to mitigate centralized risks and prevent information leakage and manipulation in decentralized applications. This unlocks credible and confidential DeFi mechanisms and AI models.

Instead of relying on slow or centralized, one-size-fits-all solutions, Fairblock’s dynamic confidential computing optimizes the security and performance of MPC/FHE protocols for each specific DeFi and AI application. Our network supports general-purpose computations, enabling use cases such as:

- Fair and dynamic price discovery for intents
- Fair and simple token launches through leaderless sealed-bid auctions
- Confidential AI
- Private lending and clearing markets
- Private data monetization
- Hidden-information GameFi
- Private Voting

Fairblock has been live on the public testnet since ETHDenver 2024, fostering a native ecosystem of 20+ fast and efficient applications. We collaborate with teams such as Anoma, CoWSwap, Ritual, and Squid in our performant and efficient native ecosystem while also delivering seamless confidential computing to EVM chains—including Arbitrum, OP Stack, Ethereum, and Monad—as well as all Cosmos SDK chains and Solana. This ensures an interconnected environment for users and developers, high liquidity, and strong native activity within our network.
