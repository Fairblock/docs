# Why Fairblock

<!-- TODO - reword this copy that was the original intro to remove redundancies that arise after the reorg. -->

Encryption is desperately lacking in blockchain networks and their applications. This lack is a critical roadblock to the global adoption of blockchains - a roadblock that stands tall for millions of everyday users and institutions alike.

Fairblock is building programmable encryption solutions that serve as building blocks for decentralized applications and networks. Weâ€™re developing encryption services that can be integrated directly into application frontends and as deep as the protocol level of blockchains. 

# How Fairblock Works

Fairblock's appchain, The `fairyring` chain uses Threhsold IBE (Identity Based Encryption) to allow users to encrypt transactions using a public key,
which then decrypts and executes automatically at the target height.
For this to work, the derived private key required to decrypt the transactions must be created on a per-block basis to leave no room for front-running.
Also, once the derived private key is available, the encrypted transactions must be executed before any other transactions from the mempool.
This is the crux of the operation of the `fairyring` chain.

More specifically, the `fairyring` chain is responsible for generating identities (encryption keys).
It is also responsible for generating the aggregated key for each corresponding identity (decryption keys).
On `fairyring` itself, any encrypted transactions can also automatically be decrypted and executed when a decryption key is made available. This means that the `fairyring` chain can have its own thriving ecosystem as other appchains do.

The following flow gives an idea of how `fairyring` works.
