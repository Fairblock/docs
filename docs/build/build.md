# Building cApps with FairyRing and Other Chains

Within this section, we'll get into the specifics of building on FairyRing, and how to build with other chains, including setting up your own chain to work with FairyRing.

> We recommend checking out building a cApp within 5 minutes before digging too deep into the technical aspects within this section.

### Tutorials

These tutorials will guide you through the steps to spin up a local blockchain quickly and deploy your own cApps using FairyRing functionality.

When working with FairyRing, there are two main developer audiences that have been highlighted. Each tutorial has elements for both audiences to assist them. These audiences are:

1. Blockchain Developers working on their own chains leveraging Fairblock, including, but not limited to, Roll-Ups and Cosmos Chains.
2. App Developers creating apps on EVMs or other blockchains.

> **App Developers do not need to know how to setup the blockchain integration, and Blockchain Developers do not need to know how to setup apps.**

> **Within each tutorial, developers are invited to skip ahead if they have already integrated the Fairblock modules within the chain that they are working with. This is the recommended route app developers take if possible, and is clearly marked within the beginning of each tutorial.**

More tutorials are being actively worked on showcasing different integration setups, and will be published more over the coming months. If you would like help integrating with a different tech stack that our current tutorials do not cover, please reach out!
