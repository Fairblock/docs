# KeyShare Submission

Keyshares have to be generated by validators off-chain and submitted using the `SendKeyshare` Tx in the KeyShare module. Although not every validator has to submit their keyshares, a threshold number of 2/3rd validators must submit their keyshares every block to generate the decryption key for that block.

## Generating Keyshares

Currently we have an API for validators to get their part of share. In order to be able to get the share from API, validators are required to generate a RSA public key & private key and send us their public key. Once we added the public key to the API, validators will be able to send a request and the data encrypted by their private key to the API for getting their share. The responses from the API are encrypted using the senders public key and it can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key.
After getting the share, every validator would need to derive the keyshare for N + 1 block using their share.

We are working on decentralizing this process by moving the key generation process on-chain. In particular, we are using the approach described in the [ETHDKG paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/985).

## Submitting Keyshares

After generating KeyShares for a particular block, validators can submit them to the FairyRing Chain via the `SendKeyshare` Tx in the Keyshare module. Currently, validators submitting an invalid KeyShare will be slashed, but there is no penalty for failing to submit keyshares. However, we plan on implementing a slashing mechanism to penalize validators for missing KeyShare submissions and/or reward validators for submitting them in a timely manner.
